## Project: ForgetfulNUS

ForgetfulNUS is a flashcard application designed to assist students in learning the German Language, specifically those undertaking the NUS modules LAG1201 and LAG2201, as a memory aid for vocabulary.

Responsibilities for the project: 
* Developer
* Documentation overall-in-charge

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Ability to sort the glossary according to the parameter input by the user.
  * What it does: allows the user to sort the glossary based on the parameter they input, such as by chronological or alphabetical order for instance.
  * Justification: This allows the user to navigate their glossary much more easily and adds another degree of customisability to the glossary.
  * Highlights: To implement sorting by chronological order, I created a new Order field to be used in every FlashCard, which also required significant refactoring. Also required integration with my teammate's `Difficulty` field to implement sorting by difficulty.
  
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=tjwjoe&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
