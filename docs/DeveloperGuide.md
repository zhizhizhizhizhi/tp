### <a name="architecture"></a>Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/forgetfulnus/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initialises the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common_classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui_component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic_component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model_component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage_component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.
For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### <a name="ui_component"></a>UI Component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/forgetfulnus/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### <a name="logic_component"></a>Logic Component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/forgetfulnus/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `GlossaryBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a Flashcard).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add g/German e/English")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add g/German e/English` Command](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### <a name="model_component"></a>Model Component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/forgetfulnus/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the glossary data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### <a name="storage_component"></a>Storage Component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/forgetfulnus/storage/Storage.java)

The Storage component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the user scores data in json format and read it back.

`JsonAdaptedFlashCard` and `JsonAdaptedScore` are Json-friendly versions of 
the `Model`’s respective `FlashCard` and `Score` classes. Similarly, `JsonScoreList` and 
`JsonSerializableGlossary` are Json-friendly versions of the `Model`’s respective `UniqueFlashCardList` and `UniqueScoreList` classes. These Json-friendly classes handle Json serialization and deserialization, so glossary and score data can be saved and read from their respective .json files.

### <a name="common_classes"></a>Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.forgetfulnus.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## <a name="implementation"></a>**Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### <a name="predefined_tags"></a> Predefined Tags

This feature is facilitated by `PredefinedTags`, `DifficultyTag` and `GenderTag`.

There are two types of predefined tags for each flash cards. They are the `DifficultyTag` and `GenderTag`. 

The following class diagram outlines the structure of the predefined tags and how it interacts with other `Model` components.

![PredefinedTagClassDiagram](images/PredefinedTagClassDiagram.png)

To go for a more OOP solution, both `DifficultyTag` and `GenderTag` were made to extend from an abstract class `PredefinedTag`.
 
Referring to the class diagram above, note that `DifficultyTag` also implements `Comparable` for use in the sorting feature. As ForgetfulNUS does not support sorting by `GenderTag`, it does not implement `Comparable`.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens for the `DifficultyTag` when a user executes the Add command:

![DifficultyTagActivityDiagram](images/DifficultyTagActivityDiagram.png)

For `GenderTag` the activity diagram is similar, with the default tag being set to `NONE` instead. Note that even if a flashcard does not appear to have a `GenderTag`  on the UI, each flashcard will always have a `GenderTag`. The UI will just not display anything for a `NONE` state.

### <a name="quizzing"></a> Quizzing
The proposed quiz feature for users to test their vocabulary is facilitated by `Model` and `Command`. It does so by allowing a command to set `Model` to quiz mode. When the model is in quiz mode, it will take in commands allowing users to attempt to type the correct definition, skip the flashcard under test or end the quiz.

It implements the following operations:

* `Glossary#quiz(Model)` — Starts the quizzing with the displayed flashcard list.
* `Glossary#try(Model)` — Attempt to type the correct English definition of the German phrase on the current flashcard.
* `Glossary#next(Model)` — Skips the current flashcard under test.
* `Glossary#end(Model)` — Ends the quiz.

These operations are exposed in `Ui` as commands. They are implemented by `QuizCommand`, `TryCommand`, `NextCommand` and `EndQuizCommand` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the quiz mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application with an existing list of flashcard. Flashcards from this list will be tested in the order of their index, and the list can be customised by using the `find <search phrase>` command.

Step 2: User enters `quiz` and the program will execute the QuizCommand on the current model. The model will be set to quiz mode and will be expecting quiz commands like `try <attempt>`, `next` and `end`. The Ui will update to hide all the English definitions on the flashcards. The first flashcard on the list will be tested when the quiz begins.

Step 3: The user enters `try <attempt>` and the `GlossaryParser#parse(String)` will parse input into a TryCommand with the attempt. If the attempt matches the English definition of the flashcard, the flashcard index, score and question count in `model` increment. The Ui will update to show the English definition of the current flashcard. The next flashcard on the list will be tested. 

If the attempt does not match, step 3 will repeat.
Alternatively, the user can enter `next` to execute the NextCommand on the model. The flashcard index and question count in `model` will increment, the Ui will update to show the English definition of the current flashcard andthe next flashcard and the next flashcard will be tested. 

Step 4: The quiz mode will end when there is no next flashcard i.e. current flashcard is the last on the list, and the user attempts the English definition correctly with `try <attempt>` or the user skips the card with `next`. Alternatively, the quiz can be ended early at any point during the quiz when the user enters `end`, letting the program execute the EndQuizCommand on the current model. The Ui will update to show the English definitions on all the flashcards in the flashcard list.

The following activity diagram outlines the process of quizzing:

![QuizActivityDiagram](images/QuizActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the quiz operation works:

![QuizCommandSequenceDiagram](images/QuizCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Quizzing also works in tandem with `find` and `sort` features, allowing users to limit the phrases tested and change the order of testing.

During quizzing, only `try`, `next` and `end` commands are allowed to be used. All other commands except `help` and `exit` will remind the user that they are in quiz mode and to end the quiz first before using any other commands.

### <a name="random"></a> Random Quizzing

This feature is facilitated by `RandomQuizCommand` and `RandomQuizCommandParser` and `Model`.

`RandomQuizCommand` implements the method:

* `RandomQuizCommand#execute(Model)` — Returns a `CommandResult` which begins a round of vocabulary quiz containing the specified number of flashcards randomly selected from the existing glossary.

`RandomQuizCommandParser` implements the method:

* `RandomQuizCommandParser#parse(String)` — Returns a `RandomQuizCommand` which ensures the specified number of flashcards is valid.

`Model` implements the method:

* `Model#setRandomQuizMode(boolean)` — Sets the state of Model to randomQuizMode and backs up or retrieves the original glossary depending on the boolean value.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the random quiz mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application with an existing glossary of flashcards that the user added previously.

Step 2. The user executes `random 5` command to randomly select 5 flashcards from the existing glossary to test his/her own vocabulary. The `random 5` command calls `RandomQuizCommandParser#parse(String)` which checks the validity of the argument given to `random` command. This then leads to the calling of `RandomQuizCommand#execute(Model)`, which in turn calls the `Model#setRandomQuizMode(boolean)`.

Step 3. The change of state of the Model resulting from `Model#setRandomQuizMode(boolean)` starts a round of vocabulary quiz for the user when the boolean parameter provided is true.

The following sequence diagram shows how the random quiz mechanism works:

![RandomQuizSequenceDiagram](images/RandomQuizSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the random command:

![RandomQuizActivityDiagram](images/RandomQuizActivityDiagram.png)

### <a name="scoring"></a>\[Implemented\] Saving Score History

This feature saves scores from previous rounds of quizzing. It is facilitated by classes in the `Command`, `Model` and `Storage` components.

A list of past scores is saved in a local file, which is exposed in the `Storage` interface as `Storage#getScoreFilePath()`.

Scores are encapsulated in the `Model` by `Score` objects, which store scoring information that can be retrieved from the following methods:

* `Score#getScore()` - Returns the number of flashcards answered correctly in the quizzing round
* `Score#getNumQuestions()` - Returns the number of flashcards tested in the quizzing round
* `Score#getFlashcards()` - Returns a list of flashcards tested in the quizzing round

Each time the quiz mode is entered and ended, a `Score` object is created and added to a `ScoreList`, where the following methods are implemented:

* `ScoreList#addScore()`
* `ScoreList#getScoreList()`

The scores can be retrieved and viewed by entering the `scores` command. The following sequence diagram
summarises how retrieving the scores works:

![RandomQuizSequenceDiagram](images/RandomQuizSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

Storing `Flashcard`s in each `Score`:

* **Current Implementation**: Each `Score` object contains a list of each `Flashcard` tested in a round. 
This is a potentially storage-intensive feature that could result in the same flashcard being saved in 
multiple scores. This would cause duplication of data in the `scores.json` data storage file.
* **Alternative**: Currently, the only score information displayed to the user on use of the 
`scores` command are:
    * Number of flashcards answered correctly
    * Number of flashcards tested
    * List of German phrases tested
    
    Therefore, each `Score` object could just store a list of German phrases tested (as Strings) instead of a list of `Flashcard`s. This reduces storage use as each `Flashcard` object contains additional data fields that are not used in the score history feature, like tags.

* **Justification for Current Implementation**: Storing all `Flashcard`s allows possible future extensions of the score history feature, such as:
    * A feature to test all flashcards associated with a particular score, allowing users to improve their performance
    * A feature to display whether each flashcard was answered correctly in a particular round of quizzing. Storing `Flashcard`s allows this information to easily be added to each `Flashcard` as a data field.


### <a name="sorting"></a> Sorting

The Sort feature is implemented as a way for users to further customise their view of the glossary and make it easier for them to find phrases they want.

Sorting is implemented as a `SortCommand` class which extends from the abstract `Command` class and makes use of a `SortCommandParser` and `GlossaryParser` to parse the parameters input by the user.
This is in line with the original AddressBook3's Command pattern.

`SortCommand` relies on several pre-defined `Comparator` objects to execute the sorting, one of which is selected for use when
the user's input is successfully parsed by `SortCommandParser`. For example, when the user inputs `sort english`, a SortCommand object is created
with a `Comparator` to compare the `EnglishPhrase`s of each `FlashCard` object in the `Glossary`.

This class diagram outlines the structure of `SortCommand` and `SortCommand` and how they interact with 
other aspects of the program.

![SortCommandClassDiagram](images/SortCommandClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram briefly outlines the execution process when a user enters the command "sort english":

![SortCommandSequenceDiagram](images/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

1. The user command is first passed into `LogicManager`, which calls upon `GlossaryParser` to parse the command.
1. `GlossaryParser` identifies the input as a command to sort the glossary, creates a `SortCommandParser` and calls its `parse(String)` method.
1. The new `SortCommandParser` parses the parameter and creates a new `SortCommand`.
1. `LogicManager` calls the new `SortCommand`'s `execute(model)` method.
1. `execute()` calls `SortCommand`'s own `getSortedGlossary()` method to obtain a sorted `Glossary`.
1. The sorted `Glossary` replaces the current `Glossary` in `Model`.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

**Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

#### Alternatives:
1. Sorting replaces the entire Glossary with a new sorted Glossary (current implementation)

   - Pros: Fairly adaptable from existing commands
   - Cons: Large glossary size may lead to computational delays and overhead

1. Sorting sorts the current Glossary in place instead of creating a new Glossary

   - Pros: Less computational overhead
   - Cons: Original AB3 implementation uses immutable Glossary equivalent, requires very significant refactoring of code to achieve.
   Using a mutable Glossary also makes the code more vulnerable.

### <a name="viewing_scores"></a> Viewing Past Scores

1.  Viewing a non-empty score list
    1. Prerequisites: 
        * List all flashcards using the `list` command. 
        * Multiple flashcards in the glossary. For simplicity, the flashcard with German phrase ‘vergesslichkeit’ and English phrase ‘forgetfulness’ should not already exist in the glossary. 
        * For simplicity, let the score list be empty (easily done through `reset scores`).
   
    1. Test case: `quiz` -> `end quiz` -> `scores` <br>
    Expected: The score and German phrases tested in this attempt are shown.
    
    1. [To be executed immediately after (b)] Test case: `add e/forgetfulness g/vergesslichkeit` -> `quiz` -> `end quiz` -> `scores` <br>
    Expected: The score and German phrases tested in this attempt are shown at the top of the list, above the previous attempt.
